This blog outlines some of the implementation details, architecture decisions behind it and the challenges we faced while working on this huge project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code which is being discussed in this blog can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/shravanasati/everynyan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-idea">The Idea&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Inspired by the movie Social Network, me and my friend &lt;a href="https://ni3rav.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nirav&lt;/a> thought of working on a social media website exclusive for our institute&amp;rsquo;s students - with a twist - everything would be &lt;strong>anonymous&lt;/strong>. The core feature of the website would be to create posts on certain boards (eg. confessions, gyan, random&amp;hellip;), where other users could vote them (up or down) and write comments on the post. If it sounds a lot like 4chan and reddit, your observations are astute.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding and breaking the Caesar cipher</title><link>https://shravanasati.me/posts/caesar-cipher/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 17:52:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shravanasati.me/posts/caesar-cipher/</guid><description>&lt;p>The caesar cipher is one the oldest known ciphers known to mankind. As the story goes, the Roman emperor Julius Caesar used it extensively for military communications. It is a simple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substitution cipher&lt;/a> and is not fit for any modern usage, since it is a trivial task to break it. However, it may be worthwhile to learn the roots of cryptography, as this cipher leads to more advanced ones like the VigÃ¨nere cipher and the unbreakable one-time pad cipher. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to implement Caesar cipher in Python, and how to break it without knowing the shift involved, using frequency analysis and some statistics. That being said, I am neither a cryptanalyst nor a statistician, so pardon me for any mistakes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Everything Suddenly Goes Berserk in Production</title><link>https://shravanasati.me/posts/production-berserk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 18:00:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shravanasati.me/posts/production-berserk/</guid><description>&lt;p>I often tend to take a look at the websites I&amp;rsquo;ve deployed - to check whether they are still online or not (I should use monitoring services). It also helps with the gloom that appears on my face when I view the website analytics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One such time was the fine summer morning of 13th June 2024. I woke up late and checked my mobile for notifications (there weren&amp;rsquo;t any). I decided to perform the health check of my websites. All of them were working fine, except &lt;a href="https://animeviz.ninja" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animeviz&lt;/a>. When I opened it, it showed the default 502 Bad Gateway error page of nginx - which meant the python server was down. I was flabbergasted really - there weren&amp;rsquo;t any recent code changes (last commit on the repository was almost 20 days ago). I kind of saw what was coming for me - a long debugging session. I slept back again and didn&amp;rsquo;t start solving the problem until 11:30 AM.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Achieving Infinite WPM in MonkeyType using Python</title><link>https://shravanasati.me/posts/selenium/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 00:32:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shravanasati.me/posts/selenium/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I have this one friend who constantly boasts about his sub-200 WPM typing speed. I tried competing with him but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage it above 100 WPM. I decided it was not worth the effort since I could beat him with the help of Python! :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the awesome &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selenium&lt;/a> library for this task.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="margin-top: 3rem;">&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just intermediate-level knowledge of Python and HTML tags. That&amp;rsquo;s all. I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining selenium along the way. This is essentially a selenium tutorial since I love project-based learning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

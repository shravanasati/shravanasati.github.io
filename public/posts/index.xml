      <description>I often tend to take a look at the websites I&amp;rsquo;ve deployed - to check whether they are still online or not (I should use cutting edge tools like kubernetes). It also helps with the gloom that appears on my face when I view the website analytics.
One such time was the fine summer morning of 13th June 2024. I woke up late and checked my mobile for notifications (there weren&amp;rsquo;t any).</description>

      <description>So I have this one friend who constantly boasts about his sub-200 WPM typing speed. I tried competing with him but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage it above 100 WPM. I decided it was not worth the effort since I could beat him with the help of Python! :)
We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the awesome selenium library for this task.
Prerequisites Just intermediate-level knowledge of Python and HTML tags. That&amp;rsquo;s all. I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining selenium along the way.</description>

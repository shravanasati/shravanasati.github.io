That\u0026rsquo;s all. I\u0026rsquo;ll be explaining selenium along the way. This is essentially a selenium tutorial since I love project-based learning.\nWhat is Selenium? Selenium is a browser automation library which has bindings available for several programming languages, including Python. We\u0026rsquo;ll be exploiting the power of the selenium webdriver, which allows us to control the browser programmatically.\nSelenium is mostly used for automated testing purposes, and occasionally to do such cool things.\nInternally, selenium uses webdrivers provided by browsers such as the GeckoDriver for Firefox, the Chromedriver for Chrome and so on to control the browser.\nDevelopment Setup We need three things installed on our system to write selenium scripts - the language libraries, the browser we want to use, and the driver for that specific browser.\nThis used to be a cumbersome process for users and often led to a lot of confusion among beginners. Fortunately, the selenium team developed the selenium manager which automatically manages the browser and driver, and ships with language libraries.\nThus all we need to do is to install the selenium library for Python.\nThis is simple:\npip install selenium==4.9.1 (v4.9.1 because I\u0026rsquo;m also using it.)\nIdeally, you should also create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies from the system-wide ones. Read more about it here.\nWriting the Script Let\u0026rsquo;s get to writing the code now.\nFirst of all, let\u0026rsquo;s import the selenium library.\nfrom selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service as FirefoxService # from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.wait import WebDriverWait import selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions as EC from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException You might notice\nThe Result Going forward ","date":"April 26, 2020","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/selenium/","summary":"So I have this one friend who constantly boasts about his sub-200 WPM typing speed.

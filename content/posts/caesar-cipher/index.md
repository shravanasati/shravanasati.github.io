The caesar cipher is one the oldest known ciphers known to mankind. As the story goes, the Roman emperor Julius Caesar used it extensively for military communications. It is a simple [substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) and is not fit for any modern usage, since it is a trivial task to break it. However, it may be worthwhile to learn the roots of cryptography, as this cipher leads to more advanced ones like the Vig√®nere cipher and the unbreakable one-time pad cipher. We'll learn how to implement Caesar cipher in Python, and how to break it without knowing the shift involved, using frequency analysis and some statistics. That being said, I am neither a cryptanalyst nor a statistician, so pardon me for any mistakes.

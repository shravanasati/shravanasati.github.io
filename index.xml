As the story goes, the Roman emperor Julius Caesar used it extensively for military communications. It is a simple substitution cipher and is not fit for any modern usage, since it is a trivial task to break it. However, it may be worthwhile to learn the roots of cryptography, as this cipher leads to more advanced ones like the Vig√®nere cipher and the unbreakable one-time pad cipher.</description></item><item><title>How Everything Suddenly Goes Berserk in Production</title><link>https://shravanasati.me/posts/production-berserk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 18:00:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shravanasati.me/posts/production-berserk/</guid><description>I often tend to take a look at the websites I&amp;rsquo;ve deployed - to check whether they are still online or not (I should use cutting edge tools like kubernetes). It also helps with the gloom that appears on my face when I view the website analytics.
One such time was the fine summer morning of 13th June 2024. I woke up late and checked my mobile for notifications (there weren&amp;rsquo;t any).</description></item><item><title>Achieving Infinite WPM in MonkeyType using Python</title><link>https://shravanasati.me/posts/selenium/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 00:32:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shravanasati.me/posts/selenium/</guid><description>So I have this one friend who constantly boasts about his sub-200 WPM typing speed. I tried competing with him but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage it above 100 WPM. I decided it was not worth the effort since I could beat him with the help of Python! :)
We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the awesome selenium library for this task.
Prerequisites Just intermediate-level knowledge of Python and HTML tags. That&amp;rsquo;s all. I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining selenium along the way.</description></item></channel></rss>
